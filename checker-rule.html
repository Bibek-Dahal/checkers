      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>The objective of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them so they cannot move.</p>

      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <p>The game is played on an 8x8 board with alternating dark and light squares. Each player has 12 pieces of their color (typically black and white or red and white) placed on the three rows closest to them.</p>

      <h2>Movement</h2>
      <p>Pieces move diagonally forward to an adjacent empty square. Capturing an opponent's piece is done by jumping over it to an empty square immediately beyond it.</p>

      <h2>Capturing</h2>
      <p>If a piece can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it, it must do so. Multiple jumps are allowed if they are available in a single turn.</p>

      <h2>Kinging</h2>
      <p>When a piece reaches the farthest row from the player, it becomes a "King." Kings can move and capture both forward and backward.</p>

      <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
      <p>The game is won by capturing all of the opponent's pieces or by blocking them so they cannot make a move.</p>
